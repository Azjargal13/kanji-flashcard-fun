# A week challenge #1

This project main aim is to **challenge myself for implementing a web application** within a week.

It should not be a simple web-app, instead it need to require some solid knowledge of JS/TS, front-end dev, framework specific and clean/efficient implementation.

Requirement:
- structured components
- using API, making request and receiving response (if required async/await should be used)
- good design (color, fonts, UI components)
- memory efficient
- database handling (for client-side data) if required
- user friendly
- testing is not necessary for this week challenge (next!)

Framework:
- Vue
- Typescript language

Plugins:
- Babel
- Eslint
- Vuetify
- mdi/icons and fonts

Timeline:
- starts from: `5th of March, 2020`
- End: `12nd of March, 2020`
